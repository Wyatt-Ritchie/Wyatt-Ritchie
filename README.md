<p>
  There is an overall project I am working on, that is a <a href="https://github.com/Wyatt-Ritchie/generic-2d-engine">2D Engine</a>. This engine is written entirely in C++, and it uses the SDL library for managine sprites, tetxtures and my overall rendering flow. This is a rather large project that I expect to act as a personal code base from which I can jump off from to make some games. Currently I have implemented a <a href="https://github.com/Wyatt-Ritchie/Tetris-Clone">Tetris Clone</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/Wyatt-Ritchie/Minesweeper">Minesweeper Clone</a> using this engine.
  <br><br>
  The current major component that I am implementing for this project is a collision system. The current method for collision detection simply iterates through each actor and checks if it has a circle component, and if that component intersects with any other circle components. Current improvements are going to extend this system to include rectangles, and other geometry. Post-collision behavior is not currently defined, as there is no physics system aside from some force based movement. So following the collision system will be a rigidbody physics compnent for more natural looking simulations.
