<h1 align="center"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Wyatt Ritchie</h1>


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Tactical RPG.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to program video game AI using states, game design, and better coding documentation
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some video game related projects! I'm not overyly picky, just interested in working with some like minded folks to create some games.

<h3 align="left">Current Project Info</h3>
<p>
  There is an overall project I am working on, that is a <a href="https://github.com/Zivarius/generic-2d-engine">Generic 2D Engine</a>. This engine is written entirely in C++, and it uses the SDL library for managine sprites, tetxtures and my overall rendering flow. This is a rather large project that I expect to act as a personal code base from which I can jump off from to make some games. Currently I have implemented a <a href="https://github.com/Zivarius/Tetris-Clone">Tetric Clone</a> using this engine. The next thing that I am working on is a tactical RPG. This game will not be unlike games in the Fire Emblem/Advance Wars/XCOM franchises, just in 2D. 
  <br><br>As someone who considers themselves as more of a programmer than an artist, the art for an RPG takes a long time to make. But in due time I will have something to showcase on this GitHub page. Until then I will continue to update the engine repository as I add components.
